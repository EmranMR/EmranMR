## About me! 👀

Hi 👋 My name is Emran, and my cyber nickname is Alch3m1st 😎! I am a qualified pharmacist and have been pracitsing as one for 7 years and counting. It turned out it was not what I thought it was, I basically got scammed put it that way 😂.

Computer and programming has always been a passion of mine so I self taught myself vigrously on the side; using various many website, articles and docs. I am also starting my Msc in Software Development in Glasgow University this year 🎓. 

I decided to go back to university, just so that it would consolidate my knowledge, and give me the confidence that I need to progress professionaly as I severly suffer and suffered from imposter syndrom. To a point I fear to even apply for a job. 

My dream would be to completely leave pharmacy and become a full time dev/software engineer.
However until then I decided to start and maintain a couple of open source projects and I am actively contributing to other projects as much as I can. 

I really enjoy open source, so regardless I will be around repos forever!

## Open Source Projects that I am working on:
- [AlpineJS Nova Extension](https://github.com/EmranMR/AlpineJS-Nova-Extension)
- [tree-sitter-blade grammar](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade)
- [Laravel Suit for Nova (TBA)](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension)
## Main Tech Stack (full stack):
- PHP 8.2 ❤️ (and obviously HTML 😛)
- Laravel 
- Livewire 
- AlpineJs 
- TailwindCSS
- Javascript

## Other Techs that I am comfortable with
- Caddy Server
- Docker
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- Tree-Sitter
- Soketi

## Operating Systems I like
1. MacOS
2. Linux, specifically Ubuntu


## I also love Dev/Ops (my tutorial hell and guilty pleasure...🙈):

- I do alot of crazy things on my own VPS and host alot of services including but not limited to:
- Host my own laravel apps including the backends like Redis, database and email
- Comfortable using Plesk
- Host my own localtunnel
- Hosting my own code-server, so that I can remotely work
- Hosting my own VPN infrustructure using outline and NordVPN
- Thankfully I can mess around with Docker nowadays before trashing an entire VPS (I have done that in the past 😅)

## My Setup
- I use Nova as my main editor by panic [VIM ❤️ mode]
  - Followed by VSCode when I am not at my iMac, esp for remote dev. Not because I want to, but because I have to, thanks to Microsoft lying and killing Atom (tbf everyone knew the innevitable) 😑
- Raycast ❤️
- Obsidian
- iTerm ❤️ Fig
- Starship
- DuckDuckGo
- Fira Code Nerd Font
- Amphetamine
- Affinity Entire Suit (for design etc including UI)
