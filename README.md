## About me! ðŸ‘€

Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Emran, and my cyber nickname is Alch3m1st ðŸ¤–! 
I am a pharmacist but computer and programming have always been a passion of mine so I self taught myself vigrously on the side; using various many website, articles and docs. I am also starting my Msc in Software Development in Glasgow University this year ðŸŽ“, to further consolidate.

My dream would be to completely leave pharmacy and become a full time dev/software engineer.
However until then I decided to start and maintain a couple of open source projects and I am actively contributing to other projects as much as I can. 

I really enjoy open source, so regardless I will be around repos forever!

## Open Source Projects that I am working on:
- [AlpineJS Nova Extension](https://github.com/EmranMR/AlpineJS-Nova-Extension)
- [tree-sitter-blade grammar](https://github.com/EmranMR/tree-sitter-blade)
- [Laravel Suit for Nova (TBA)](https://github.com/EmranMR/Laravel-Nova-Extension)
## Main Tech Stack (full stack):
- PHP 8.2 (and obviously HTML ðŸ˜›)
- Laravel 
- Livewire 
- AlpineJs 
- TailwindCSS
- Javascript

## Other Techs that I am comfortable with
- Caddy Server
- Docker
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- Tree-Sitter

## Operating Systems I like
1. MacOS
2. Linux, specifically Ubuntu
